# Developer Survey Portal of DocChameleon
This repository contains the code for a web-based survey portal designed to collect user feedback to evaluate **DocChameleon**‚Äîan LLM-based tool that automatically customizes TensorFlow API documentation. Through this portal, users can compare the official TensorFlow documentation with the customized versions generated by DocChameleon.

## üìå Motivation
Understanding and using machine learning APIs effectively often depends on the clarity and usability of the documentation. TensorFlow‚Äôs official documentation, while comprehensive, may not always be tailored to the user's context or experience level. **DocChameleon** addresses this by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate personalized, context-aware documentation.

This survey portal helps us assess how users perceive the quality, clarity, and usefulness of the customized documentation compared to the official TensorFlow docs. This feedback is crucial in refining DocChameleon and enhancing the developer experience.
